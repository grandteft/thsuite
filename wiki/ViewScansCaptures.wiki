== Option 2 - Check scans for usable handshake(s) ==
Previous scans are listed as numbered .csv files and can be chosen by entering the corresponding number.
----
On choosing the scan number, the associated .cap file will be checked for valid/usable handshakes using pyrit.
  If valid handshakes are found, a list is generated with information on the networks for which a valid handshake found. 
----
An option is then given to strip out the handshakes for each listed network.
  (Handshakes are stripped from .cap file and saved as /root/SSID.cap)

  * If individual file is chosen then the the file is named with the date and time of the THSuite scan.
