----
This option makes use of airodump-ng to scan for wireless networks.
----
On selecting wireless scanning from the main menu, you are prompted to enter a monitor interface or warned if none exist.
----
You are then prompted to either enter scan settings or use the default settings;
  * Channel to scan on (default is all channels)
- If you chose the default(scanning on all channels), you will be prompted for a channel hop delay in seconds or skip (hit Enter) to use airodump-ng's default.
  * Scan time (default is no limit)
----
airodump-ng will then be opened in an xterm window which will either stop after the entered scan time, or if scan time was left as default, continue until stopped with Ctrl-C.
----
Scan results will be saved in the /root/THS_TMP/ directory.
